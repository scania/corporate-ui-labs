                    <p class="lead">How do you create a great user experience (UX)? Start here!</p>

                    <p>Here we present a graphic design with colour schemes and fonts together with design guidelines
                        for common design elements. You will soon be able to find guidance on such things as error
                        messages, buttons, tables etc. By using this you help us create a common user experience for the
                        Scania end users. They will be able to recognize their internal application as a Scania
                        application. They will be able interact with common design elements in similar ways regardless
                        of the application. Thereby we will help them focus on their work instead of the IT system.</p>

                    <p>To those of you who develop web applications, we also offer you Scania Bootstrap. Here you can
                        find descriptions of how you can develop with the Scania Bootstrap CSS and JS-framework. You can
                        find examples, codes for each component and functional prototypes and examples.</p>

                    <p>This is only a start package. If you want to take UX (and usability) seriously, you should also
                        involve UX resources in your project. If you want technical assistance, contact <a href="mailto:jesper.karlsson@scania.com">Jesper Karlsson</a>.
                        If you want general guidance on UX or usability, contact <a href="mailto:susanna.christensson@scania.com">Susanna Christensson</a>. We are happy to meet up and discuss possible ways that we, or others in the UX team can help you.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Did you know that we're currently working on a totally new user experience? Scania Boostrap is currently extended to form the new Corporate UI. It includes our new branding guidelines including fonts, logotype and colors. </p>
                    <p>If you're using Scania Bootstrap today, the basic updates that you'll need to do will be available in version 2.0.0. If you're not using Scania Bootstrap, start planning to do so! Find out more about the new interface at the <a href="http://static.scania.com/ux-library">UX Library</a> </p>

                                our UI-guidelines and you get a lot of hard UX-work for free.</p>

                    <p>We generate value for Scania through globally standardized methods for user involvement. We analyze the usersâ€™ needs instead of what they say they need. We collect data and analyze instead of focusing on individual opinions. We use sketches and prototypes early in the process to make requirements concrete and tangible for both orderers and users. Here's a <a href="img/UX-Process.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version</a> containing our proposed UX process.</p>
