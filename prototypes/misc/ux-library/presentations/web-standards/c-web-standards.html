<h1>Web Standards - and why are they important?</h1>























  <ul>

    <li>There are two important main institutes for standardization : World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Ecma International.</li>

    <li>Ecma International specifies EcmaScript (for browser it's called JavaScript).</li>

    <li>W3C specifies HTTP, HTML, CSS, XML, Ajax and "Web Components" and much more.</li>

  </ul>



















  <h2>HTML Elements</h2>

  <xmp>

    <h1>I am located in a standard HTML element</h1>

    <input type="text" placeholder="Input is also a standard element, but it's a more complex element. A sort of a native Web Component" />

    <p>Now we can also use <custom-elements></custom-elements> that is also browser native (hmmm...they will be), though their behaviour is not:</p>


    <c-alert>
         <p>Hi there, since my element name includes a dash, you know that I am not one of HTML's standard elements.</p>
    </c-alert>

  </xmp> 


      <h2>Sensors API is here!</h2>

      let sensor = new Gyroscope
            sensor.start();






















  <h2>Modularized Web App Design</h2>

  <p>Using HTML standards make's it easy to share and re-use code between web pages, hybrid apps, dev teams, applications and companies.</p>

  <p>Let's have a look at a (little) more advanced examples:</p>

<h2>JavaScript Engines and Polyfills</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Chrome and FireFox are using V8</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer is using Chakra</li>
  <li>Safari is using...</li>

</ul>

<p>Polyfills are JavaScript functionallity to extend a browser to understand standards that wasn't built in to the browser when shipped.</p>

<p>Polyfills are naturally demanding a lot from the JavaScript engine, trying making it act like a browser that it's not.</p>

<p>The basic piece of advise: If your application itself is demanding a lot from the JavaScript Engine, be extra carefull using Polyfills. If your application are a singe page application spun out of control, you might want to re-design the application before using any Polyfills.</p>
