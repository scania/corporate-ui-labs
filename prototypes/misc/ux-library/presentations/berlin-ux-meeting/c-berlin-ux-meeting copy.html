<h1>Corporate UI - An open source framework controlled by ourselfes</h1>

Making Modular HTML based application development possible.

Documentation available at www.github.com/scania/corporate-ui

Code (basic package) are available at www.github.com/scania/corporate-ui

















We are learning to create a good User Experience

But we still are working in silos. One project can't re-use code from another project. We even find projects where teams have created the same functionallity in a SINGLE PAGE APPLICATiON.

Corporate UI are an enabler to re-use between teams, projects and companies. It is framework agnostic and are used by .Net teams, JAVA teams as well as Angular and React teams. The main navigation is a good example and it's a cross functional pattern crucial for an overall user experience.














Custom Elements are the future

We now package interaction patterns as <custom-elements>. It is a new standard and work exactly as standard HTML elements.

<h1> H1 is a standard element </h1>

<input type="checkbox" placeholder="Input is actually a native Web Component">

<ux-process> Would be a custom element that the UX designers control </ux-process>



Let's look at an example:

Distributed ownership

Packaging HTML, CSS and JS as rock solid interaction patterns or content modules owned and controlled by the UX Designers. Application developers can't screw things up!

Main navigation are hosted on a cdn network while the patterns are hosted with the UX team.

Let's look at an example: 
https://scania.github.io/corporate-ui-docs/template/html-copy-paste/html-copy-paste.html


You can include Analytics links within each element as well.


















A common specification

If we could agree on a common Web Component specification for creating and storing components it would be a great start. 

Start demanding all advertising agencies to deliver "white labled components" easy to re-use within the group.

















Polymer and Polyfills

World Wide Consortsium is setting standards to be implemented in all major browsers.

Chrome and Safari, as Evergreen browsers, are quick to implement new standards.

Polymer are simply using JavaScript code to make old browsers understand the current specification from W3C.

Polymer aims to get rid of itself, as standards are built into the browser.















Deploying a simple Web Component

This presentation can easily be turned into a web component and called upon using a custom element, for example:

<!--       <berlin-ux-meeting></berlin-ux-meeting>    -->

  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'berlin-ux-meeting',
      ready: function() {
