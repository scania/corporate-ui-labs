      <h1>Corporate UI - An open source framework controlled by ourselfes</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Making Modular HTML based application development possible.</li>
        <li>Documentation available at www.github.com/scania/corporate-ui</li>
        <li>Code (basic package) are available at www.github.com/scania/corporate-ui</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>We are learning to create a good User Experience</h2>
      <p>But we still are working in silos. One project can't re-use code from another project. We even find projects where teams have created the same functionallity in a SINGLE PAGE APPLICATiON.</p>
      <p>Corporate UI are an enabler to re-use between teams, projects and companies. It is framework agnostic and are used by .Net teams, JAVA teams as well as Angular and React teams. The main navigation is a good example and it's a cross functional pattern crucial for an overall user experience.</p>

      <h2>Custom Elements are the future</h2>
      <p>We now package interaction patterns as <xmp><custom-elements></xmp>. It is a new standard and work exactly as standard HTML elements.</p>
 
      <xmp>
        <h1> H1 is a standard element </h1>
        <input type="checkbox" placeholder="Input is actually a native Web Component">
        <ux-process> Would be a custom element that the UX designers control </ux-process>
      </xmp>

      <h3>Let's look at an example:</h3>
      <p><a href="https://scania.github.io/corporate-ui-docs/ux-process/demo.html?brand=scania" target="_blank">https://scania.github.io/corporate-ui-docs/ux-process/demo.html?brand=scania</a></p>

      <h2>Distributed ownership</h2>
      <p>Packaging HTML, CSS and JS as rock solid interaction patterns or content modules owned and controlled by the UX Designers. Others can't screw things up rather than working only with their defined components.</p>

      <p>Main navigation and other UI components are hosted on a CDN service while the documentation are hosted with the UX team.</p>

      <h3>Let's look at an example:</h3> 
      <p><a href="https://scania.github.io/corporate-ui-docs/template/html-copy-paste/html-copy-paste.html" target="_blank">https://scania.github.io/corporate-ui-docs/template/html-copy-paste/html-copy-paste.html</a></p>
      <p>You can include Analytics tags within each element as well, even for a simple button or an alert message.</p>

      <h2>A common specification</h2>
      <p>If we could agree on a common Web Component specification for creating and storing components it would be a great start.</p>
      <p>Start demanding all advertising agencies to deliver "white labled components" easy to re-use within the group.</p>

      <h2>Polymer and Polyfills</h2>
      <p>World Wide Consortsium is setting standards to be implemented in all major browsers.</p>
      <p>Chrome and Safari, as Evergreen browsers, are quick to implement new standards.</p>
      <p>Polymer are simply using JavaScript code to make old browsers understand the current specification from W3C.</p>
      <p>Polymer aims to get rid of itself, as standards are built into the browser.</p>

      <h2>Deploying a simple Web Component</h2>
      <p>This presentation can easily be turned into a web component and called upon using a custom element, for example:</p>

      <xmp>
        <berlin-ux-meeting></berlin-ux-meeting>
      </xmp>  

      <h3>It's actually this component that are delivering the content that you've just been reading! View the source in your web browser and you'll find it there...</h3>
